Influential YouTuber. Wrote a young adult novel _An Absolutely Remarkable Thing_ in which he basically spells out the grand plan (a puzzle that all of humanity contributes to, towards the best possible world for all of us).

He is very aligned (calls out misinformation in his own tribe, elevating people's discernment which improves the world for all tribes). 

He's laying the ground work for hyperstition (in his novel there is a magical book called "The Book of Good of Times" that predicts the future, but it only works if people follow it, he then started actually writing this book in real life!)
