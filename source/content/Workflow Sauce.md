Sees the vision. Is both an engineer and human universal translator. 

On resolving all human disputes / human alignment he said:

> My rationalist take is a straight sum of the perspectives is not enough—it’s like assembling a puzzle or cooking a soufflé; order and alignment matters. Throwing them all in a pile just makes a bunch of noise.

> It’s a lifetime of work for one man, an couple of weekends of work for all of humanity

> A human hackathon, if you will





Goes well with blair & KJ
